<p>At Badoo, we operate an open plan office that we find generates a creative and exciting environment to work in. We
    think that this environment and buzz is unique, and therefore we want all of our visitors to experience this too!</p>

<p>However, because of this, we do need certain assurances from our visitors that what they learn about their visit,
    stays confidential - after all it's what makes us who we are!</p>

<p><b>Please therefore sign below and return to reception.</b></p>

<p><b>Thanks, and enjoy Badoo!</b></p>
